# Proxy Configuration Test Guide

## Issue Identified

The signin is failing because there's **no backend server running on port 8080**.

## Current Status

✅ Proxy configuration is correctly set up in `proxy.conf.json`
✅ Angular dev server is configured to use the proxy
❌ Backend server is not running on port 8080

## Required Actions

### 1. Start Your Backend Server

You need to start your Spring Boot backend server on port 8080. Run your backend application first.

### 2. Verify Backend is Running

Test that your backend responds on port 8080:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/user
# or visit http://localhost:8080/user in browser
```

### 3. Test Proxy Configuration

Once the backend is running, the proxy will work as follows:

**Frontend Request:** `http://localhost:4200/user`
**Proxied to:** `http://localhost:8080/user`

## Debug Steps

### Check if Angular Proxy is Working

When both frontend and backend are running, you should see:

1. No more 404 errors
2. Requests in browser dev tools showing 200 status
3. Successful signin

### Verify Environment Configuration

The current environment config is correctly set to:

- **Development:** Returns empty string (uses proxy)
- **Production:** Returns Railway URL

## Expected Flow

1. ✅ Start backend server on port 8080
2. ✅ Angular dev server is already running with proxy
3. ✅ Signin should work: `/user` → `localhost:8080/user`

## Current Proxy Configuration

```json
{
  "/user": {
    "target": "http://localhost:8080",
    "secure": false,
    "changeOrigin": true,
    "logLevel": "debug"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

**START YOUR BACKEND SERVER FIRST**, then test the signin again.
