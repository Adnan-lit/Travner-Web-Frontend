## Key Services

### MarketplaceService
The core service that handles all API communications with the backend. It includes:
- Product catalog operations (browse, search, get details)
- Cart operations (add, update, remove items)
- Order operations (checkout, list, get details, cancel)
- Admin operations (product CRUD, order lifecycle management)

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Different error types for various scenarios (validation, network, server, etc.)
- Toast notifications for user feedback

## Routing

All marketplace routes are integrated into the main application routing:

```
/marketplace                    # Product listing
/marketplace/products/:id       # Product details
/marketplace/cart               # Shopping cart
/marketplace/checkout           # Checkout process
/marketplace/orders             # Order history
/marketplace/orders/:id         # Order details

/admin/marketplace/products     # Admin product management
/admin/marketplace/orders       # Admin order management
```

## Authentication & Authorization

- Public access to product catalog (browse and search)
- User authentication required for cart and checkout operations
- Admin authentication required for admin features
- Role-based access control using existing auth guards

## Responsive Design

All components are designed to be fully responsive and work on:
- Desktop browsers
- Tablet devices
- Mobile phones

## Implementation Notes

### Caching Strategy
- Product grid cached by query parameters with short TTL
- Product details revalidated if version changes
- Cart is user-specific and not cached across sessions

### Performance Optimizations
- Debounced search inputs
- Optimistic UI updates where appropriate
- Efficient pagination for large datasets

### Security Considerations
- Basic Authentication for API requests
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization

## Dependencies

This implementation relies on:
- Angular core services and routing
- Existing authentication service
- Toast notification system
- Responsive CSS design patterns

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements that could be added:
- WebSocket order status updates
- Currency conversion engine
- Product soft-delete/archive functionality
- Atomic stock decrement with conditional updates
