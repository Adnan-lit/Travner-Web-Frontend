# MVP Requirements Fulfillment Report

This document verifies that all requirements from the MVP specification have been properly implemented.

## Role: Senior Angular Engineer (Clean MVP)

✅ **Objective Met**: Implemented all documented backend APIs in the Angular frontend in a clean, minimal, and well-structured way.

## Authoritative Specs Compliance

### ✅ API Endpoints Implementation
- All endpoints implemented exactly as documented in API_REFERENCE.md
- Response envelope `{ success, message, data, pagination? }` properly handled
- Pagination structure exactly as specified

### ✅ Authentication

- Base64(username:password) header injection working correctly
- Public endpoints properly excluded from auth

### ✅ Error Handling
- HTTP status codes 400/401/403/404/409/422 properly handled
- Success flag checked and message displayed per response guidelines

## Project Setup and Architecture

### ✅ Feature Modules with Lazy Loading
- Core module for shared services and interceptors
- Auth module for public registration and authentication
- User module for profile management
- Posts module for browsing/searching posts
- Chat module for conversations and messages
- Market module for products, cart, and orders
- Admin module for administration functions

### ✅ Angular Standalone Components
- Consistent use of standalone components throughout
- No NgModules mixing for uniformity

### ✅ Strict TypeScript Interfaces
- All DTOs have strict TypeScript interfaces
- Shared types folder created with ApiResponse<T>, Pagination, and domain models
- Type safety enforced across all services

- State kept local to services using BehaviorSubjects
- No NgRx or external state libraries used
- Simple and predictable state patterns

## Environment and Configuration

### ✅ Environment Configuration
- Environments with baseUrl implemented

## HTTP and Interceptors

### ✅ BasicAuthInterceptor
- Injects Authorization: Basic <base64> for protected calls

### ✅ ApiEnvelopeInterceptor
- Unwraps { success, message, data } where helpful
- Still exposes full envelope to callers
- Errors mapped backend codes with descriptive messages
